Chapter 1 : Data Structure and Algorithm
=========================================

**Data Structure and Algorithm** is important part of computer science. Here sort explain about data structure and algorithm : 

## Data Structure
**Data Structure** is a system to store data in computer memory. 

> A **Data Structure** is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

## Algorithm 
**Algorithm** is a spacify set of step to solving problem.

> In computer programming terms, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input(s) and produces the desired output.
